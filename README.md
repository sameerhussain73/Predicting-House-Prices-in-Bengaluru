**Bengaluru House Price Prediction**
**Project Description**

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices in Bengaluru. The project leverages various housing features to forecast prices, providing a valuable tool for real estate analysis in the Bengaluru area.

**Dataset**
The dataset includes a comprehensive range of features such as locality, area, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. Each record in the dataset corresponds to a unique property listing in Bengaluru.

**Approach
Data Preprocessing:**
**Feature Engineering:** Developed new features that could potentially aid in better price prediction.
**Handling Missing Values:** Devised strategies to manage missing data without compromising the dataset's integrity.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
**Data Visualization: **Utilized various plots and charts to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
**Statistical Analysis: **Performed statistical tests to understand the relationships between different variables.
**Model Building and Evaluation:**
**Algorithm Selection: **Experimented with various regression models to find the most effective one for this dataset.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employed techniques like grid search to optimize the model's performance.
**Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.

**Results**
The final model demonstrates a robust capability to predict house prices in Bengaluru with a significant accuracy level, providing insights into the factors most affecting property values in the region.

**Tools and Technologies**

**Python:** Primary programming language used.

**Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical computation.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating insightful data visualizations.

**Scikit-learn:** For model building and evaluation.

**Usage**
Instructions for setting up the environment, exploring the dataset, conducting EDA, and running the prediction model are included. Users can follow these to replicate the analysis or build upon the existing model for more nuanced insights.
